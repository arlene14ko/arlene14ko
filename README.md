### Hi there, I am Arlene. 👋

#### A Junior Data Scientist based in Antwerp, Belgium.

##### NOW

- ✨ Currently creating a project using deep learning techniques for a start up company in Antwerp
- 💬 Recently created a project about Natural Language Processing (NLP) Text Summarization using HuggingFace Transformers. 
- ⚙️ Co-created a project about [customer churn prediction](https://predicting-churn.herokuapp.com/) to help predict if a customer is likely to churn.  
- ✨ Co-created a [machine learning model](https://codit-usecase.herokuapp.com/) to predict if an industrial machine will malfunction using sound. 
- 🔭 Currently learning about unsupervised learning, data clustering, and model deployment.
